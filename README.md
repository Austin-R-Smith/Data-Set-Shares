# Data-Set-Shares

See word documents for write ups on each data set. 

Code for both data sets are included in the same Jupyter Notebook: "Data Set Shares: Reviews of Popular Books."

The other Jupyter Notebook included in the repo is the code that scrapes information for the most sold books in history. It is titled "Best Selling Books of All Time - Wikipedia Web Scrape." This data can be used to find the author, title, publish year, original language, approximate sales, and genre; all information that may be interesting to add to review data.
